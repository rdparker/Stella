    - Others...

  * Add a debugger to Stella for game developers


For the Windows port of Stella (Cyberstella):

  * More Columns / Advanced sorting for the GUI

  * Make all dialog boxes resizable for any size text

  * Improve the DirectSound support

  * Add Fullscreen / Windowed mode - Alt-Enter

  * Add a Direct3D version, so we have alpha-blending, hardware stretch, etc.

  * Add commandline options that were in StellaX

  * Add Screenshots in PNG format - F12

  * The following features depend on developer availability

    - Add a Sprite/Animation Editor 
    - Add a PF Editor

    - Either Support DASM as frontend or integrate a 6507 Assembler

    - AVI/MPEG export
    - WAV/MP3 export
    - Client/Server networked play for up to 4 Computers via LAN/Internet
    - Tracking Hiscores
    - Record and Playback games - not as real movie, but by logging
      Input/RAM/processor states in given intervals.
    - Cheatcodes
    - Improve frontend by adding snapshots, labels, manuals, etc.
      Like KStella for Linux. (Suggestion from Brian Luttrull)
