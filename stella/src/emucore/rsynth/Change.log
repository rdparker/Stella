	More oddities - none of stops "stop" - weird - added

Change 2598 on 2002/12/30 by nick@dromedary

	Turn of debug :-(

Change 2588 on 2002/12/28 by nick@dromedary

	Improve mbrola .pho file interpollation:
	  - allow length reduction for non stops
	  - invent new attribute 'stl' (stop locus) to mark in/out
	    elements of stops so only central part is marked as stp
	    (with above this means in/put can change length).
	         - Remove specific [A:] etc. entries in phtoelem.def and handle
	           ':' in phtoelm.c 

Change 2587 on 2002/12/28 by nick@dromedary

	reasons ;-)

Change 2574 on 2002/12/23 by nick@dromedary

	#if to switch between taking 1st diff of output + lowpass
	or not doing either (supposed to be equivalent).
	The non-diff case should make it easier to inject specific 
	voice waveform.

Change 2573 on 2002/12/23 by nick@dromedary

	Some light tidying

Change 2570 on 2002/12/22 by nick@dromedary

	Add x-sampa [4] [K] [?]

	Tweak duration code with comment till we are clearer
	about effects to shortened durations on the parameter
	interpollation.

Change 2537 on 2002/11/25 by nick@dromedary

	Support say -f whatever.pho 
	where whatever.pho is a mbrola phone/duration/f0 file.
	Interpolation between durations in ms and frames is 
	still a little rough. Also have some issues when specified 
	duration is less than duration of stops (and maybe some others.)
