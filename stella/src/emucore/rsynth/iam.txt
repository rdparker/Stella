This is R-synth - a formant synthesizer.
R-synth takes a list of phonemes 
described in John Well's SAMPA encoding of the IPA, 
and generates speech using a digital model of the vocal tract.

The festival speech synthesis system, can use r-synth to generate a 
voice to read conventional english text. 
Prosodic information is generated by festival and fed to r-synth.
