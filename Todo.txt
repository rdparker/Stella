===========================================================================

If you would like to contribute to Stella's development then feel free to
contact me by email:

  Stephen Anthony (stephena@users.sf.net).


The following is a list of items that I plan to get to sooner or later.
Note that currently I'm the only person working on Stella, maintaining
the code across three major platforms (Linux, MacOSX, Windows), so my
time is very limited:

  * Convert code to SDL-1.3/2.0.  The next major revision of SDL hasn't
    been released yet, but I'm already in the process of working with
    beta versions.  The main reason for this change is to have hardware-
    accelerated Direct3D support in Windows (which currently uses
    OpenGL, and isn't as fast as it is on other systems).  As well, I'll
    no longer have to maintain separate software and OpenGL renderers
    within Stella; SDL will handle it all behind the scenes.

  * Add Blargg NTSC TV filters.  This will be OpenGL only for now.
    Eventually when I move to SDL 2.0, it will be available for any
    accelerated backend (Direct3D, OpenGL, OpenGLES, etc).

  * Add support for esoteric controllers.  KidVid support is almost done;
    still TODO are Mindlink and Lightgun.

  * Add more debugger features, improve graphics access tracking, improve
    GUI, etc.

  * Fix final remaining bugs in the TIA emulation.

  * Add rewind support to the entire emulation, not just in the debugger.

  * Look into adding movie recording or net play.

  * Probably a thousand other things that I've forgotten.
